                    Finally finished my crash course on AngularJS, so to celebrate I routed my pages so that everything runs smoother!
                    Is it a lot of code? No. Am I really proud of myself? Yes! Not only did it clean up a LOT of my previous HTML code, but 
                    taking these small baby steps in developing my technical side makes me feel like I'm making progress. 
                    Now all I need to do is work on my financial economics, start pinging an API for stock market data, and soon we'll
                    all be rich (and not make really stupid options trades like I have been the past week haha).

                    Glanced at the Theory of Computing homework and realized I might as well have been reading the instructions in Arabic.
                    So I'm procrasting by working on the website. Trying to aim for a more professional look with the grey variant. It
                    looks really depressing though, so I'm thinking of a background picture. Need to look up how to do transitions. It's definitely
                    a work in progress, but I'm surprised at how much I've done the past day or so. By the end of today I'll have a logo and
                    a picture of myself up. I think the hardest part of today will be finding a good picture of myself lol. <br/>11:25PM Update: Having
                    trouble finding a background. I'll get on that tomorrow, and put in a simple web scraper to see how to implement projects directly
                    onto the website if I get my Theory homework done.

                    Hey guys this is a webpage I made myself today. It has absolutely nothing on it (not even CSS), but at least I got the namespace
                    and the server running. It was a good refresher of what I did last summer at least. 
                    Hopefully I can update this website every other week. Stay tuned!
