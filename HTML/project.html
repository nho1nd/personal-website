                Hello! My name is Nathaniel Ho, and I am a sophomore studying Computer Science and Economics at the University of Notre Dame.
                I am interested in learning more about data science and analytics. I am very motivated, and will take the initiative
                to always get goals accomplished, whether it be finishing a project or answering a lingering question. Hopefully, this
                website and future projects posted here will atttest to that. Feel free to look around, and please reach out if you
                have any questions! - Nate
